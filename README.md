## üìñ About The Project

The Personalized Learning Assistant is a revolutionary learning tool, powered by Google's state-of-the-art **Gemma 3n** model, designed to overcome one of the biggest obstacles in education: the "one-size-fits-all" approach. This intelligent assistant smartly assesses each user's current knowledge level on a topic and then creates a dynamic, completely personalized learning path with custom-generated content, reinforcement quizzes, and interactive Q&A sessions. By running this entire process locally on the user's device, our project makes learning not only more effective but also **completely private and accessible offline.**

## üöÄ Key Features

* **üéì Adaptive Level Assessment:** Dynamically generates an initial quiz to determine the user's knowledge level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
* **‚úçÔ∏è Personalized Content:** Creates tailored topic explanations and suggests resources from scratch, based on the assessed level.
* **üß© Knowledge Reinforcement:** Offers a 10-question mini-quiz to solidify learning and ensure retention.
* **üí° Interactive Feedback:** Provides detailed explanations for incorrect quiz answers, not just showing the right answer but explaining the *why* behind it for true comprehension.
* **üí≠ Deep Dive Q&A:** Allows users to ask any follow-up questions about the generated content, enabling curiosity and a deeper exploration of the topic.
* **üåê Bilingual Support:** Fully functional in both English and Turkish.
* **üîí 100% Private & Offline:** Powered by `Ollama`, all processing happens on the user's own device. No data ever leaves the machine, and no internet connection is required.

## ‚ú® The Core Idea: The Adaptive Learning Loop

Our project guides the user through a pedagogically sound, four-step learning cycle to maximize learning outcomes:

1.  **ASSESS:** What do you know? The app first measures your current proficiency with a short pre-quiz.
2.  **LEARN:** Fill in your knowledge gaps by reading content that is custom-generated for your specific level.
3.  **TEST:** Solidify your new knowledge by taking a mini-quiz that tests for comprehension.
4.  **DEEPEN:** Achieve mastery by asking specific questions in the interactive Q&A section to clarify any points of confusion or curiosity.

## üí° Why Gemma 3n? The Power of Local AI

The choice of the **Gemma 3n** model for this project was a deliberate, strategic decision. Our goal was to leverage the model's unique capabilities to solve real-world problems.

* **Privacy & Trust:** Gemma 3n's ability to run locally ensures complete privacy in a sensitive domain like education. Users' learning data and personal information never leave their own devices.
* **Accessibility:** By functioning without an internet connection, the application bridges the digital divide, making quality learning tools accessible to people in any geographic or socio-economic situation.
* **Versatility:** In this project, we used Gemma 3n not as a simple chatbot, but as a multi-faceted **Assessment Designer**, a **Personalized Tutor**, a **Quiz Master**, and a **Socratic Q&A Partner**. This showcases the model's flexibility and its potential in a wide range of complex tasks.
